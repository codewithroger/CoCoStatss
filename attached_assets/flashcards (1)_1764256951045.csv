What is the primary function of correlation as a statistical tool?,To measure and describe the strength and direction of the relationship between two or more variables.
What are the two key questions that correlation helps to answer about variables?,"Do the variables move together, and if so, how strongly?"
"In the context of correlation, if daily exercise increases and weight decreases, what can be said about the two variables?",The two variables are said to be correlated.
How does correlation aid in prediction?,"If a strong correlation exists, one variable can be predicted based on the other, such as predicting marks from study hours."
"In business, how is correlation used for decision making?","Companies use it to understand customer behavior, such as the relationship between income and spending."
What type of correlation is observed when one variable increases and the other variable also increases?,Positive Correlation.
What is a classic example of positive correlation?,The relationship between height and weight.
What type of correlation is observed when one variable increases while the other decreases?,Negative Correlation.
What is a common business example of negative correlation?,"As the price of a product increases, the demand for it decreases."
What is meant by 'Zero Correlation'?,There is no meaningful or discernible relationship between the variables.
Provide an example of two variables that would likely have zero correlation.,Shoe size and intelligence.
"What is the correlation coefficient, and what is its symbol?","It is a number between –1 and +1 that shows how strong a relationship is, symbolized by 'r'."
What does a correlation coefficient (r) value of +1 signify?,"A perfect positive correlation, where variables change in the exact same proportion."
A correlation coefficient (r) in the range of +0.7 to +0.9 indicates what kind of relationship?,A high positive correlation.
What type of relationship is indicated by a correlation coefficient (r) between +0.3 and +0.6?,A moderate positive correlation.
What does a correlation coefficient (r) of 0 mean?,There is no correlation between the variables.
A correlation coefficient (r) in the range of –0.3 to –0.6 suggests what kind of relationship?,A moderate negative correlation.
What type of relationship corresponds to a correlation coefficient (r) between –0.7 and –0.9?,A high negative correlation.
What does a correlation coefficient (r) value of –1 signify?,A perfect negative correlation.
What is a major limitation of correlation regarding cause and effect?,Correlation does not imply causation; one variable moving with another doesn't mean it causes the movement.
How can outliers affect correlation results?,"Extreme values, or outliers, can distort the true correlation between variables."
Correlation is most effective at measuring what type of relationship between variables?,It primarily measures linear relationships and may fail if the relationship is curved or complex.
What statistical measure does the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r) provide?,It measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two sets of continuous data.
The Pearson Correlation Coefficient tells you how close data points are to forming a _____.,straight line
What is the range of possible values for the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r)?,The value of r is always between -1 and +1.
"In the Product Moment Formula for Pearson's r, what does $S_{xy}$ represent?",$S_{xy}$ represents the sample covariance.
"In the Product Moment Formula for Pearson's r, what do $S_x$ and $S_y$ represent?","$S_x$ and $S_y$ represent the sample standard deviation of x and y, respectively."
What does covariance measure?,Covariance is a statistical measure that indicates how two variables change or vary together.
"If both variables tend to increase or decrease at the same time, the covariance will be _____.",positive
What does a negative covariance indicate about the relationship between two variables?,"It indicates that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease."
"If there is no clear pattern in how two variables change together, what can be said about their covariance?",The covariance is close to zero.
"In the formula for population covariance, what does $N$ represent?",$N$ represents the total number of data points in the population.
What is the key difference in the denominator between the formulas for population covariance and sample covariance?,"The population formula divides by $N$, while the sample formula divides by $n-1$."
What does Spearman's rank correlation measure?,"It measures how well the relationship between two variables can be described using a monotonic function, based on their ranks."
Spearman's correlation is used when the data is not normally distributed or when the data is _____.,ordinal (ranked)
What is a monotonic relationship?,"A relationship where as one variable increases, the other variable consistently increases or consistently decreases."
What does a positive monotonic relationship mean?,"As one variable increases, the other variable always increases."
How does Spearman's correlation work with raw data scores?,It converts the raw scores into ranks and then checks the relationship between those ranks.
"In Spearman's correlation, if the ranks of two variables are very similar, what does this indicate?",It indicates a positive correlation.
"In Spearman's correlation, if the ranks of two variables are random with respect to each other, what is the likely outcome?",There is no correlation (a coefficient near 0).
"In the formula for Spearman's rank-correlation coefficient, what does 'n' represent?",The number of observations in the sample.
"In the Spearman's rank correlation formula, what does $d_i$ represent?",$d_i$ represents the difference between the ranks for each observation ($x_i - y_i$).
What is the first step in calculating Spearman's correlation if the data is not already ranked?,Rank the data for each variable separately.
"After ranking the data, what is the next step in calculating Spearman's correlation?",Find the difference (d) between the ranks for each pair of observations.
What is done with the difference in ranks (d) before it is summed up in the Spearman's formula?,Each difference (d) is squared to get $d^2$.
What does a Spearman's correlation value of +1 indicate?,"A perfect positive relationship, meaning the ranks move together exactly."
What does a Spearman's correlation value of -1 indicate?,"A perfect negative relationship, meaning the ranks move in exact opposite directions."
What is a real-life question that Spearman's correlation could help answer about academic performance?,“Do students who score high in Maths also score high in Science?”
"In economics, what is a common pair of variables studied using correlation?",Income versus consumption.
"In finance, correlation is often used to analyze the relationship between _____ and _____.",risk and return
